				<h1 class="centered">WHAT IS ALCOHOL?</h1>
				</div>
				<hr>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>There are four main groups of drugs: Stimulants, which increases alertness and energy, depressants, which decreases alertness and energy, hallucinogens, which cause people to hallucinate and are unable to think clearly, and inhalants, which deprive the body of oxygen. Alcohol is classified as a depressant drug, meaning that consuming alcohol slows down the body's functions. The user would feel droswy, their movement might feel unsteady, and would not react quickly.</p>
				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->




				







				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p> Alcohol is found in drinks such as beer, wine, spirits, cider, etc. Although there are certainly some who like drinking alcohol, there are many risk factors included with drinking. The liver can only process one "standard" drink (14g of alcohol) in an hour, and consuming more than that could affect the person's health. (More on the consequences could be found below)</p>

			<div class="causetitle"><h1>INFLUENCES</h1></div>
			<p>
			There are numerous influences that could cause people to drink. Below is a list of major influences that are the most common for teens. However, remember that not all influences are listed here. If you see that you are heavily influenced by one of the categories, you should remember to be aware of that.</p>
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Peer Pressure</h2></div></div>
					<p>Peer pressure is one of the biggest influences for drug use among teenagers. Because popularity is very significant to most teenagers, they might try taking drugs in order to seem cool and fit. Furthermore, friends might also try to persuade you into drinking alcohol.  </p>
					<p>
						 Friends might also try to persuade you into drinking alcohol. They might say that you will be cool if you drink, or that drinking is fun.</p>

						<br><br>
						<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">

					<h2>Drink Spiking</h2></div></div>
					<p>Although this does not necessarily count as an influence, drinking drinks containing alcohol without your knowledge is a cause for consuming alcohol. Spiking occurs mostly at a party, or at a bar, etc. In order to avoid spiking, be cautios of drinks given by other people. Try smelling the drink to see if you can sense alcohol.</p>

					
					

				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
					
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle"><h2>Stress</h2></div></div>
					<p>Stress is extremely common in teenagers. They have to get good grades, undergo peer pressure, and have to do well in extra-curricular activities such as sports. </p>

					<p>Since alcohol is a depressant, it slows down the bodily functions and the ability to process information. Therefore, stressed teenagers feel less stressed when drinking and feel as if their problems don't exist. However, their problems still do exist - and drinkers will most definitely have more problems if they are caught drinking.</p>
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Excitement/Curiosity</h2></div></div>
					<p>For those who enjoy the 'thrill' aspect of life and crave excitement, they might want to try alcohol. Alcohol gives teens something to do and could bring excitement in some ways. Others who are naturally curious about what alcohol does mightx cause them to try alcohol themselves. </p>
					
				
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
		
		


				
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="causetitle">

				<h2>Media</h2></div></div>
					<p>Media such as movies and TV shows sometimes make it seem like taking drugs is an okay thing to do. The user might take a high dosage of drugs and get away with absolutely no consequences. Because of this, people might think that they will also take drugs without having consequences too.</p>

					<p>A survey compared 12-17 year olds who watched 3 or more R-rated movies in a month to those who didn't. Those who viewed 3 more R-rated movies in a month were 5 times more likely to drink alcohol. </p>



					
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Accessibility</h2></div></div>
					<p>Alcohol is much more accessible than other illegal drugs (e.g cocaine, heroin, etc), since it is legal in most countries and there are numerous drinks that contain it. Although it is illegal for teens to drink in almost all countries, it is still much easier to possess alcohol than other illegal drugs because of how accessible it is.</p>

			<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h1>CONSEQUENCES</h1></div></div>
			<p>There is a plethora of consequences that come with drinking. The consequences are separated below into two catergories: short term and long term. If you do consume alcohol, remember to take it in small doses to avoid harmful consequences (the liver can only process one "standard" drink (14g of alcohol) in an hour).</p>
				<div class="col-lg-6 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Short Term</h2></div></div>
					<p>As touched on above, alcohol is a depressant and slows down the bodily functions. If a low dosage is consumed, the user will feel relaxed and calm (and possibly be happy because of that), and they will have a slower reaction time than usual. The user's coordination will also be slightly reduced.</p>

					<p>If a medium dosage is consumed, the user might feel sleepy, and they will have slurred speech and blurry vision. Users could also have altered emotions and act moodily; they might be tempted to behave irrationally. </p>

					<p>If a high dosage is consumed, the user will vomit uncontrollably. He/she would be disoriented, have breathing difficulties, and might even lose consciousness. Extremely high dosages will result in comas, blackouts, and death.</p>

					<p>Additionally, the user might become more popular among his/her peers that also drink for a short amount of time. However, he/she might not be liked among others that do not drink alcohol, because they might not approve of their abuse of alcohol.<p>

					<p>Lastly, a "hangover" is normally received several hours after the ingestion of alcohol. The user is susceptible to headaches, dizziness, faituge, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, etc.</p>

					
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
					
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Long Term</h2>
					</div></div>
					
					<p>Most of these consequences occur only if the user continues to abuse alcohol. Brain damage would be done, and normal brain development will be disrupted - affecting the user academically. More serious health issues could develop, such as throat/mouth cancer, liver disease, a vitamin B<sub>1</sub> deficiency, ulcers, gastritis, and various heart-related diseases.
					</p>

					<p>Some alcohol abusers might feel happy from drinking so much. However, most people who abuse alcohol will feel stressed and sad due to the the inability to quit drinking. Relationships and friendships could be harmed and broken, as not many people will approve of the user's abuse of alcohol.
					</p>

					<p>Drinking during pregnancy could lead to a child with 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome' (FAS). Children with FAS could grow less quickly, have problems with their nervous systems, have facial abnormalities, and have mental retardation.

						<div class="centered"><div class="stoptitle"><p><p>If you somewhow wound up in a situation where someone is offering you alcohol, it is imperative that you refuse in a strong and firm tone. Try to make the drug dealer 100% convinced that you will certainly not take a sip; using body language is a great way to do this. Additionally, try to get away from the dealer if you can. If you are fine with just drinking a bit, approach with caution anyways. </p>
						<p> Make an excuse if you can so you won't seem like a completely weird person to your peers. Say something like:"I can't, I get random drug tests", or "I'm driving home tonight, I can't risk driving while drunk". Or, you can make a joke out of it. You can say something like: "Drinking alcohol's for losers!" or "Who even drinks?"
						</p>

						<p>You can even get someone else to make an excuse for you. For example: You can call someone while at the party and tell them that there's alcohol (you can use a code word or something like that to tell). Then, the person shows up at the party and makes an excuse to bring you home.
						</p>

						<p>Lastly, make up your own strategy!</p>

						<div class="centered"><div class="stoptitle2">


						<p>Being aware of the whole alcohol situation is a great way to prevent yourself from drinking alcohol. Always be aware of what friends you hang out with. If you know they're taking drugs / they seem like the type to, always be aware of that and/or get new friends to hang out with.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you're too stressed out, you can tell an adult (i.e. parent, counselor, etc) about your problems. Talking to someone about your stress could make you feel less stressed out. 
						</p>

						<p>
							Try not to view any 'R' rated movies. Stay away from media that can influence your view on drugs and view drugs as an ok thing to do in order to be safe.
						</p>

						<p>
							Be aware of people you don't know who give you drinks. Try smelling the drink and see if it smells like alcohol. If it does, don't drink it.

						</p>

						<p>
							If you are seeking excitement, try finding another hobby. You can try playing sports, or read a book, or go for a walk, etc.

						<div class="centered"><div class="stoptitle3">
						<p>If you already abuse alcohol and want to quit, seek help from others. If you are a teen, reaching out to your parents, counselor, or a teacher would be a great idea. Reaching out to organizations that help alcoholics would also likely be a great benefit.
						</p>
						<p>
						Try setting personal goals to quit alcohol, and try to achieve those goals. Make sure the goals are 'SMART' (for more information, search up what 'SMART' goals are). An example of a goal would be: "I will completely quit drinking alcohol before July. In order to achieve this, I will limit my drinking to only 2 drinks a weekday, and 3 drinks a weekend. After that, I will keep restricting more and more until I stop drinking entirely. I will know if I have completed my goal if I continue not to drink."
						</p>
						<p>Note that there are withdrawl symptoms if you decide to quit. These include headaches, vomiting, anxiety, etc. If you have a severe case of these symptoms, go to a doctor.</p>
						<p>If someone you know abuses alcohol, find them help immediately. Talk to others about ways you can get the person to stop, and talk to the person so that they feel comfortable with the situation. Introduce them to drug rehab programs.</p>
