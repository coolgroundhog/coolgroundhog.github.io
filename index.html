				</div>
				<hr>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>The definition of environmental degradation is the <b>deterioration of the land</b>. Although nature does take some part in degradation by erosion, humans are the main cause of this, bringing more destruction to the earth's ground and soil than nature ever could. However, the most horrible part in this is that most people do not realize the magnitude of the consequences land degradation brings, such as an immense loss of agriculture. (See 'Effects' page for more info.) </p>
				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>Unlike many other important issues, such as climate change or Donald Trump, land degradation is occuring without much of anyone's attention - but as we have to remember, degradation is still one of the biggest environmental issues and deserves attentiveness. If everybody is aware of environmental degradation, people and societies as a whole could finally bring degradation to an end. </p>

			<div class="causetitle"><h1>CAUSES</h1></div>
			<p>There are numerous problems that affect land degradation - both caused by human-induced process and nature - and cause the land to deteriorate. Below is a list including major reasons that are the main cause of degradation. However, do remember that there not all causes are here; there is definitely a myraid of other reasons. Also remember that these are not in an order of importance.</p>
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Erosion</h2>
					</div>
					</div>
					<p>Erosion is one of the biggest causes of land degradation. <b>The process of erosion is to wear away the land</b>, often to a severly degraded state. Types of erosion include water, wind, ice, and gravitational erosion.  </p>
					<p>
						Water erosion slowly washes away rocks and soil by bodies of water. Wind erosion occurs when the wind carries materials from the ground and deposits them elsewhere. Ice erosion occurs when a glacier moves downhill. As this happens, the glacier pushes earth materials from the ground along with it. Gravitational erosion pulls earth materials that are loose downhill. 					</p>

				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
					
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle"><h2>Deforestation, Overgrazing</h2></div></div>
					<p> Although these two causes do not directly cause environmental degradation, <b>it removes groundcover</b> - therefore exposing the ground for water, wind, gravitational, and in some areas ice erosion. These two causes also deeply affects the regrowth of plants and therefore exposes topsoil easier. Research shows that when only 60% of a plant is grazed/removed in some way, root growth stoppage is 50%, and at 80%, the roots have no regrowth.</p>
				
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
		
				
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
				<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="causetitle"><h2>Overuse of agrochemicals</h2></div></div>
					<p>Overuse of agrochemicals are also dangerous to the soil. An agrochemical is a chemical used in agricultural (i.e. fertilizer, pesticides, etc). However, <b>an overuse of most of these chemicals results in a loss of nutrients in the soil</b>, such as zinc and sulphur and changes soil composition. </p>

					<p>The problem with overuse of agrochemicals is that many farmers and places repeatedly fall into this problem, the reason for that being they want their vegetation to grow better. However, an overuse of agrochemicals results in the exact opposite.</p>

			<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h1>CONSEQUENCES</h1></div></div>
			<p>As said before, the consequences of land degradation are monumental. Again, these consequences are not in any particular order, and do remember that there are many other consequences - these are not the only ones.</p>
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Agriculture Loss</h2></div></div>
					<p>It is harder to farm on degraded land than it is to farm on normal land. This is because the topsoil - the soil containing numerous nutrients necessary for vegetation to grow - is removed. <b>Without topsoil, the vegetation will not have the available nutrients that are mandatory for good plant growth</b>. In addition, unsustainable irrigation practices may result on salinization of soil, which is bad for crops. This, in turn, will result in a global loss of agriculture.</p>

					
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
					
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Increased flooding</h2></div></div>
					<p>Floods will have <b>more of an impact to the areas they happen</b>. This is because degraded land will have a lessened ability to soak up the water, and flooding will therefore be more common. In addition, most floods lead to more deterioration of the land - which means a vicious cycle of more degraded land causing more floods, more deterioration, more floods, and so on. If that is not enough to make the consequence seem devestating, remember that degraded land is less capable of growing groundcover, leaving the ground fully exposed to more deterioration.</p>

					
					
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->	
				
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Disruptions in ecosystems</h2></div></div>
					<p>
						The incricate networks in <b>ecosystems will be disrupted due to crusting</b> (the formation of a hard layer at the top of the soil surface). Many animals depend on the soil for survival - many live in it, hide in it for predators and weather, and more. Micro-organisms in the soil converts toxic substances into useful nutrients for vegetation. For example, ammonia is converted into nitrogen. In addition to this, topsoil is removed - so plants and trees cannot grow as well. Vegetation is home to many animals, so the homes of many animals is lost.

First of all, groundcover prevents erosion from happening, especially wind and water erosion. The plants also improves water inflitration by intercepting raindrops and slows down water evaporation, which in turn helps soil remain moist for a longer period of time. in addition to that, groundcover buffers temperatures for the topsoil, which ensures safe temperatures for topsoil to rebuild if it is lost. </p></div>

						<p>Third world countries are <b>the ones that take a toll</b>. Unlike richer countries, countries of the third world are less able to fix the issue of degradation do to the lack of money. In addition to that, more innapropiate usage and inappropiate care of the land is more likely to happen in third world countries since there is less control of these actions.</p>
						<p>These poor countries are very dependant on agriculture, as it not only provides scarce food to already hungry citizens, but also creates jobs for everybody. Land degradation causes a loss in agriculture, and therefore a loss in jobs and food too. Thankfully, many organizations and affluent countries are currently trying to ameliorate this situation in developing countries.</p>
