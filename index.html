				</div>
				<hr>
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>Alcohol is classified as a depressant drug, meaning that consuming alcohol slows down the body's functions. The user would feel droswy, their movement might feel unsteady, and would not react quickly. Alcohol is found in drinks such as beer, wine, spirits, cider, etc.</p>
				</div><!-- col-lg-6 -->
				
				<div class="col-lg-6">
					<p>Although there are certainly some who like drinking alcohol, there are many risk factors included with drinking. The liver can only process one "standard" drink (14g of alcohol) in an hour, and consuming more than that could affect the person's health. (More on the consequences could be found below)</p>

			<div class="causetitle"><h1>INFLUENCES</h1></div>
			<p>
			There are numerous influences that could cause people to drink. Below is a list of major influences that are the most common for teens. However, remember that not all influences are listed here. If you see that you are heavily influenced by one of the categories, you should remember to be aware of that.</p>
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Peer Pressure</h2></div></div>
					<p>Peer pressure is one of the biggest influences for drug use among teenagers. Because popularity is very significant to most teenagers, they might try taking drugs in order to seem cool and fit. Furthermore, friends might also try to persuade you into drinking alcohol.  </p>
					<p>
						 Friends might also try to persuade you into drinking alcohol. They might say that you will be cool if you drink, or that drinking is fun.</p>

						<br><br>
						<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Media</h2></div></div>
					<p>Media such as movies and TV shows sometimes make it seem like taking drugs is an okay thing to do. The user might take a high dosage of drugs and get away with absolutely no consequences. Because of this, people might think that they will also take drugs without having consequences too.</p>
					
					

				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
					
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle"><h2>Stress</h2></div></div>
					<p>Stress is extremely common in teenagers. They have to get good grades, undergo peer pressure, and have to do well in extra-curricular activities such as sports. </p>

					<p>Since alcohol is a depressant, it slows down the bodily functions and the ability to process information. Therefore, stressed teenagers feel less stressed when drinking and feel as if their problems don't exist. However, their problems still do exist - and drinkers will most definitely have more problems if they are caught drinking.</p>
					<br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Excitement</h2></div></div>
					<p>For those who enjoy the 'thrill' of life and crave excitement, they might want to try alcohol. Alcohol gives teens something to do and could bring excitement in some ways. Others who easily feel bored and trouble being occupied might also be tempted to try drinking. </p>
					
				
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
		
		


				
				<div class="col-lg-4 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="causetitle"><h2>Curiosity</h2></div></div>
					<p>Some people are just naturally curious about what alcohol does, and that may cause them to try alcohol themselves. They might just want to drink a bit, but they may even get addicted to alcohol just by drinking a small amount. So after drinking the first time, it is not a matter of curiosity anymore - it just feels good.</p>

				
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
					<div class="title">
					<div class="causetitle">
					<h2>Accessibility</h2></div></div>
					<p>Alcohol is much more accessible than other illegal drugs, since it is legal in most countries and there are many drinks that contain it. Although it is illegal for teens to drink in almost all countries, it is still much easier to possess alcohol than other illegal drugs because of how accessible it is.</p>

			<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h1>CONSEQUENCES</h1></div></div>
			<p>There is a plethora of consequences that come with drinking. The consequences are separated below into two catergories: short term and long term. If you do consume alcohol, remember to take it in small doses to avoid harmful consequences.</p>
				<div class="col-lg-6 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Short Term</h2></div></div>
					<p>As touched on above, alcohol is a depressant and slows down the bodily functions. If a low dosage is consumed, the user will feel relaxed and calm (and possibly be happy because of that), and they will have a slower reaction time than usual. The user's coordination will also be slightly reduced.</p>

					<p>If a medium dosage is consumed, the user might feel sleepy, and they will have slurred speech and blurry vision. Users could also have altered emotions and act moodily; they might be tempted to behave irrationally. </p>

					<p>If a high dosage is consumed, the user will vomit uncontrollably. He/she would be disoriented, have breathing difficulties, and might even lose consciousness. Extremely high dosages will result in comas, blackouts, and death.</p>

					
				</div><!-- col-lg-4 -->
					
				
				<div class="col-lg-6 callout">
					<br>
					<div class="title"><div class="consequencetitle"><h2>Long Term</h2>
					</div></div>
					<p>Most of these consequences occur only if the user continues to abuse alcohol. Brain damage would be done, and normal brain development will be disrupted - affecting the user academically. More serious health issues could develop, such as throat/mouth cancer, liver disease, a vitamin B<sub>1</sub> deficiency, ulcers, gastritis, and various heart-related diseases.
					</p>

					<p>Some alcohol abusers might feel happy from drinking so much. However, most people who abuse alcohol will feel stressed and sad due to the the inability to quit drinking. Relationships and friendships could be harmed and broken, as not many people will approve of the user's abuse.
					</p>

					<p>Drinking during pregnancy could lead to a child with 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome' (FAS). Children with FAS could grow less quickly, have problems with their nervous systems, have facial abnormalities, and have mental retardation.

						<p>Third world countries are <b>the ones that take a toll</b>. Unlike richer countries, countries of the third world are less able to fix the issue of degradation do to the lack of money. In addition to that, more innapropiate usage and inappropiate care of the land is more likely to happen in third world countries since there is less control of these actions.</p>
						<p>These poor countries are very dependant on agriculture, as it not only provides scarce food to already hungry citizens, but also creates jobs for everybody. Land degradation causes a loss in agriculture, and therefore a loss in jobs and food too. Thankfully, many organizations and affluent countries are currently trying to ameliorate this situation in developing countries.</p>
